                The jQuery Bower package contains additional files besides the default distribution. In most cases you can ignore these files, however if you wish to download the default release on it's own you can use Bower to install jQuery from one of the above urls instead of the registered package. For example, if you wish to install just the compressed jQuery 2.1.0, you can install just that file with the following command:
